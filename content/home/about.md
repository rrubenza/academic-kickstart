# About Me 

Welcome to my website! I am a first-year graduate student in astronomy 
at the California Institute of Technology, where I am supported by a 
NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I am interested in the diversity of
exoplanets and understanding where our Solar System fits in the context of these other worlds. 

At Caltech I work with [Andrew Howard](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~howard/) on radial velocity detection and characterization of exoplanets in order to understand the demographics of what planets exist in our galaxy.

Previously, I worked with [Segev BenZvi](http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~sybenzvi/index.html) at the University of Rochester
on a number of projects in gamma-ray astroparticle physics, and on
machine learning classification of galaxy spectra to identify
supernovae.
